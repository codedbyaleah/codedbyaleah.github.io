                <h2>Baking!</h2>
                <p>I have always been fascinated by cooking or baking since I was little. Making desserts and watching them turn out perfect
                would always make me happy, and eating them was always 10 times better! My sisters and I always used to make rainbow 
                jello, which was deliecious.</p>

                <h2>Traveling!</h2>
                <p>I absolutely love traveling, no matter where it is. I just recently went on a trip to Mexico with my family, and it was 
                amazing! One reason why I love traveling is because of the delicious food we stumble upon. It'so amazing to learn about the 
                country's tradition, origin, and the natives to the land. </p>
