                <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
                
                <p>I have many interest but most of them are in technology, architectural, and culinary arts. Ever since I was little I loved to create small houses or
                furniture with legos. Cooking is one of my favorite ways to pass the time, but I don't like to clean up the mess. Few hobbies of mine are drawing,
                reading, cooking, and baking. Recently, I have been baking things more often.</p>
