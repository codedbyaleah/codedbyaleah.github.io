                <h2>High Schools</h2>
                <p>I have a few choices about the high schools I plan to go to. My three choices are mainly McBride, Millikan,
                and Lakewood. I wish to learn more about computer science and coding. I prefer McBride because of their classes
                in technology. Either way, any high school will be fine. </p>

                <h2>College/University</h2>
                <p>I don't really knew what my college choices are yet, but I have a few in mind. Those are CSULB, University 
                of Washington, the University of Florida, and the Marquette Univeristy. I know, from back in 6th grade, that 
                these were the best Universities to go to for my interests in computers.</p>
