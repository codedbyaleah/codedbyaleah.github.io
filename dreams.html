                <h2>High Schools</h2>
                <p>I have a few choices about the high schools I plan to go to. My three choices are mainly McBride, Millikan,
                and Lakewood. I wish to learn more about computer science and coding. I prefer McBride because of their classes
                in technology. Either way, any high school will be fine. </p>

                <h2>College/University</h2>
                <p>I don't really knew what my college choices are yet, but I have a few in mind. Those are CSULB, University 
                of Washington, the University of Florida, and the Marquette Univeristy. I know, from back in 6th grade, that 
                these were the best Universities to go to for my interests in computers.</p>

                <h2>My Career Interests</h2>
                
                <p>I have numerous career interests that include Culinary Arts, Architecure, Interior Design, Technology, and Engineering. But my 
                mind is mostly set on computer engineering, so I will lean towards classes and jobs in that area. If I don't suceed 
                in the area of computers, that I would love to work in a resturaunt or creating layouts for houses.</p>
